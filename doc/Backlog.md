| BL-01 | Search & filtering | Add a search bar and filters by categories/service types to quickly find the desired tool. | Reduces time to locate a service and improves click-through rates. | High | Done | Implemented instant search with highlighting in map & list views. |
| BL-02 | Interaction analytics | Integrate lightweight analytics (e.g., Plausible or GA4) to track popular categories and services. | Enables data-driven prioritization of catalog updates. | Medium | Planned | Create a task with a checklist: select a platform, update policy, implement tracking code. |
| BL-03 | Catalog export | Generate CSV/JSON with the service list for analytics or CRM import. | Simplifies data sharing with other systems and consultants. | Medium | Planned | Prepare a technical plan (export button + file formats). |
| BL-04 | Mobile & accessibility | Deliver a responsive list/accordion mode with keyboard support and readable typography. | Improves the experience for users on smartphones and low-vision audiences. | High | Done | React SPA now includes a toggleable accordion view and accessible focus management. |
| BL-05 | Content playbooks | Add ready-made usage playbooks (e.g., “marketing campaign” or “support automation”). | Increases practical value and helps newcomers. | Medium | Planned | Break down into subtasks: research, copywriting, section design. |
| BL-06 | Third-language support | Add another localization, such as Polish or German, with full descriptions. | Expands the audience and supports new markets. | Low | Backlog | Prepare a language guide and involve a translator. |
| BL-07 | Logo resilience | Cache fetched logos or host critical assets locally to avoid third-party outages. | Keeps branding reliable even if logo providers throttle requests. | Medium | Backlog | Evaluate Clearbit limits and consider a build-time fetch pipeline. |
